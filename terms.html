             <li>Permission is granted to temporarily download one copy of Cyber Slider per device for personal, non-commercial transitory viewing only. This is the grant of a license, not a transfer of title, and under this license you may not:
             <ol type="i">
                 <li>modify or copy the materials;</li>
                 <li>use the materials for any commercial purpose, or for any public display (commercial or non-commercial);</li>

             </ol>
              </li>
